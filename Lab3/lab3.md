Since the company is a mid-sized retail one, and asuming no special cases are in play: <br>
key components: <br>
1. Network Infrastructure: Cloud-native networking: <br>
   Firewall/Router. <br>
   Load Balancer.  <br>
2. Web Tier: IaaS (maintain control during transition): <br>
a-   Physical Web Servers. <br>
b-   Web Services. <br>
3. Application Tier: IaaS (maintain control during transition): <br>
a-   Monolithic Application. <br>
4. Data Tier: PaaS (reduced management overhead): <br>
a-   SQL Server Database. <br>
b-   Database Services. <br>
c-   Backup. <br>
5. Storage Tier: PaaS (improved scalability): <br>
a-    File Servers. <br>
6. Services Tier: SaaS (immediate cost savings): <br>
a-    Email Server. <br>

    

Section 2: Cloud Migration Strategy: <br>

1. Web Application Migration Strategy: <br>
Recommended Approach: IaaS (Initial) → PaaS (Long-term). <br>
The benefits of such strategy will be: <br>
Quick Win: Minimal code changes required. <br>
Risk Mitigation: Maintain current architecture during initial migration. <br>

2. Database Migration Strategy: <br>
Recommended Approach: Hybrid → PaaS. <br>
The benefits of such strategy will be: <br>
a- Compatibility: IaaS SQL VM ensures 100% feature compatibility. <br>
b- Gradual Optimization: Move to PaaS after validating performance. <br>
c- Fallback Option: IaaS provides easy rollback capability. <br>

3. File Storage Migration Strategy: <br>
Recommended Approach: PaaS (Direct). <br>
The benefits of such strategy will be: <br>
a- Immediate cost savings and scalability. <br>
b- API Compatibility: Easy integration with application updates. <br>

4. Email Services Migration Strategy: <br>
Recommended Approach: SaaS (Direct). <br>
The benefits of such strategy will be: <br>
a- Total Cost Ownership: Eliminates server maintenance costs. <br>
b- Feature Rich: Modern collaboration tools. <br>
c- Security: Enterprise-grade security and compliance. <br>

Detailed Migration Plan:   

Phase 1: Foundation & Assessment
Step 1: Discovery and Assessment:  
Application Discovery  
Cost Analysis  
Step 2: Proof of Concept:  
Migrate non-critical file share to Azure Blob Storage(for example)  
Validate network connectivity with cloud VPN   

Phase 2: Infrastructure Migration:  
Step 1: Networking Foundation  
Create cloud virtual network with subnets  

Establish site-to-site VPN connection  

Configure DNS resolution between on-prem and cloud  

Step 2: Email Migration 
Migrate email services to Google Workspace(for example)

Implement hybrid email configuration during transition


Step 3: File Storage Migration 
Implement Azure File Sync(for example)

Migrate file shares in batches  

Update application configurations to use cloud storage

Phase 3: Application Migration 
Step 1: Database Migration 
Implement database replication

Conduct performance testing

Step 2: Web Application Migration
Lift-and-shift to IaaS VMs

Minimal application changes

Quick migration benefits

Phase 4: Optimization & Decommission:
Step 2: Optimization
Implement cloud monitoring and alerting

Optimize resource utilization for cost savings

Establish cloud governance policies

Step 2: Decommission
Gradually decommission on-premises servers

Validate cloud operations stability

Complete knowledge transfer
