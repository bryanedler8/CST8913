Migration Strategies:
1. Web Application Migration Strategy
Recommended Approach: IaaS (Initial) → PaaS (Long-term)

Quick Win: Minimal code changes required
Risk Mitigation: Maintain current architecture during initial migration
Familiar Operations: IT team can use existing server management skills

2. Database Migration Strategy
Recommended Approach: Hybrid → PaaS

Compatibility: IaaS SQL VM ensures 100% feature compatibility
Gradual Optimization: Move to PaaS after validating performance
Fallback Option: IaaS provides easy rollback capability

3. File Storage Migration Strategy
Recommended Approach: PaaS (Direct)

Direct Benefits: Immediate cost savings and scalability
API Compatibility: Easy integration with application updates
Disaster Recovery: Built-in geo-redundancy

4. Email Services Migration Strategy
Recommended Approach: SaaS (Direct)

Total Cost Ownership: Eliminates server maintenance costs
Feature Rich: Modern collaboration tools
Security: Enterprise-grade security and compliance
